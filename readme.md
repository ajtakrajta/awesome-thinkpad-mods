> ThinkPad is a line of business-oriented laptop computers and tablets designed,
> developed and marketed by Lenovo, and formerly IBM. ThinkPads have a distinct
> black, boxy design language, inspired by a Japanese bento lunchbox, which
> originated in 1990 and is still used in some models. Most models also feature
> a red-colored trackpoint on the keyboard, which has become an iconic and
> distinctive design characteristic associated with the ThinkPad line.
>
> ThinkPads have enjoyed cult popularity for many years. There are large
> communities on the Internet dedicated to the line where people have
> discussions about it, share photos and videos of their own ThinkPads,
> etc. Older ThinkPad models remain popular among enthusiasts and
> collectors, who still see them as durable, highly usable machines, despite no
> longer being modern. They have gained a reputation for being reliable, or
> "indestructible", even.
